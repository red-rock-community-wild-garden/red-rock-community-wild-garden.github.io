It's an exciting time as we've just been given the go-ahead to start on the garden.

One of the first steps will be to elect a board, which we'll be doing on Wednesday the 19th of May at 19:30 (at the garden).

It's also a time for gathering materials, so we're putting out feelers trying to get:

- Untreated planks (scaffolding, decking) that could be used for building raised beds
- Cardboard to help cover off parts of the soil
- Water tanks (like IBC tanks)
- Other containers for planting into
