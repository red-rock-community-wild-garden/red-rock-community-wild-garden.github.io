It's been almost 10 months since we launched and after a slow start things are really picking up now. Back on the 6th 
of February we had our first meet-up of the year and with massive support from the community we were able to assemble 
four lovely planters for the growing season. Most of the soil and compost was delivered at the bottom of the hill near 
the main entrance, but the group worked tirelessly throughout the morning to move it all up to the planters on the 
top of the hill.

We'll be meeting more often now, with regular meetups planned for at least the first Sunday of every month. With all 
the activity going on now though don't be surprised to find us in the garden more often than that. We're hoping to 
plant up the planters soon, and have a delivery of berry bushes and fruit trees to get planted soon. Things are 
really picking up!
