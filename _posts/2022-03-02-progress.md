It's been almost 10 months since we launched and after a slow start things are really picking up now. Back on the 6th 
of February we had our first meet-up of the year and with massive support from the community we were able to assemble 
four lovely planters for the growing season. Most of the soil and compost was delivered at the bottom of the hill near 
the main entrance, but the group worked tirelessly throughout the morning to move it all up to the planters on the 
top of the hill.

All that soil went into the new planters. We're hoping to plant up the planters soon, and have a delivery of berry 
bushes and fruit trees to get planted soon.

It was great to see everyone out and about, other than the planters we did a general cleanup, planted some daffodils 
and cleaned up the main entrance to make a little plant bed which we'll also hopefully have looking a bit more 
lively soon.

We'll be meeting more often now, with regular meetups planned for at least the first Sunday of every month. With all 
the activity going on now though don't be surprised to find us in the garden more often than that. Things are 
really picking up!
