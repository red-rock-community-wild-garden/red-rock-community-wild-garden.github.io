We're a mixed group of residents in the St. Luke's area that share a common interest in growing food, nature
 and just sitting out and enjoying the sun. 

The group was founded in May 2021 after months of work by Carla negotiating access to a site.

Our plan is to develop the garden, grow food, build community, all while keeping parts of the space a bit wild.
